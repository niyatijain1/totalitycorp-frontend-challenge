This is my submission for Frontend Developer Assignment_Totality Corp

Techstack- "HTML,CSS,REACT.JS,REDUX, FIREBASE, STRIPE.JS" for building the project

My approach was simple as, i used react-routing i made different pages as home page , product page , login page, cart page used them as routes in app.js file

Also made small components and used them in the pages, such as products, was the component made for home page containing all the products list and made another component productscard for every card of product, 

Also footer  component was made containing details, common in all pages,

Also made a product page so that if a user clicks on a product it redirects to a product page with all details regarding the product and can select the quantity of the product and can add the item to cart

There is a login page where user can login through google authentication that is done using "firebase" 

Inside the cart page user can reset the cart , add more items to cart and can simplify proceed to checkout and can do payment for it, Stripe is used in the project for handling online payments and processing transactions.

Also , React-Toastify is used in the project to display notification messages to the user. It provides an easy way to show toast notifications (small pop-up messages) for various events.
